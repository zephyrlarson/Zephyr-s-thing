<h1>Mt. Rainier</h1>

<p>Mt. Rainier is a place I really want to go to. It is home to 1/4 of all of america's glaciers outside of Alaska. However, climate change is causing glaciers all over the world to melt. Every day, glaciers a getting smaller.</p>
<p>Between 1896 and 2021, the land area covered by glaciers shrunk by 42%! (New York Times). This is affecting wildlife.</p>
<p>Glaciers will continue to melt in the future, and the rate will only speed up as climate change get's worse. Animals and plants that can't adapt quickly enough to the warmer climate around the mountain will die off. The effects could be catastrophic.</p>

<h3>What can you do?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>bike or walk instead of drive</li>
    <li>minimize your energy use</li>
    <li>vote (if you're old enough)</li>
    <li>eat local, and eat mostly plant products</li>
  </ul>

  <p>In the national park, people are already limiting water usage, since glacial melt is becoming a less reliable source.</p>
